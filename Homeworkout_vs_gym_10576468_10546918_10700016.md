## Summary Statistics

|     Tweet     | Mean | Median | Variance |  Sd  | IQR | Min | Max |
| :-----------: | :--: | :----: | :------: | :--: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|     \#gym     | 1.00 |   1    |   3.11   | 1.76 |  2  | \-3 |  8  |
| \#homeworkout | 0.35 |   1    |   2.02   | 1.42 |  2  | \-3 |  6  |

## Statistical Testing

**T-test assumptions:**

1.  Scale of measurement
2.  Simple random sampling
      - *not everyone uses social media the same way*
      - *language restriction*
3.  Adequacy of sample.
4.  Equality of variance in standard deviation.
      - *one point difference in variance*
5.  Normality of data distribution

## Statistical Testing

## Statistical Testing

### Shapiro–Wilk test

  - \(H_0:\) *The distribution of our data sample is not significant
    different, from a normal distribution*

  - \(H_1:\) *The distribution of our data sample is significant
    different, from a normal distribution*

**\#homeworkout** : \(P-value= 2.8 \times 10^{-16} < 0.05\)  
**\#gym** : \(P-value= 1 \times 10^{-9} < 0.05\)  
At the 5% significance level, we reject the null hypothesis \(H_0\). 

**There is a significance difference between the distributions of the
samples and the normal distribution**

## Statistical Testing

### Mann-Whitney U test

  - \(H_0:\) *The The mean ranks of the two groups are equal*

  - \(H_1:\) *The mean ranks of the two groups are not equal*

\(P-value= 3.6 \times 10^{-16} < 0.05\)  
At the 5% significance level, we reject the null hypothesis \(H_0\).  

**The sentiment mean rank scores between tweets with \#gym and
\#homeworkout are significant different**

## Conclusions

  - Observe a new trend in fitness industry where people prefer home
    workouts.

  - Businesses can use this information to produce new products and
    services therefore increase their profits in a competitive industry.
